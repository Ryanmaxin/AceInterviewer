# AceInterviewer
Students and professionals alike have limited access to valuable feedback on their responses to common interview questions within their discipline, often leading to solo-preparation with limited feedback on their responses. Our app serves as a forum for common interview questions, responses, and community feedback. Users can answer common industry questions and submit them publicly to be reviewed with feedback.
